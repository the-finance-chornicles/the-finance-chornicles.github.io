### 1. What are Patents?

The tenet of a free market system is its ability to maximise allocative efficiency through its fierce 
and free competition. The multiplicity of sellers ensures the best possible price for consumers, 
which in turn maximises societal welfare. These perks do come with their own requirements, 
namely, an impossible ideal market, which has the following attributes:

1. Perfectly rational consumers and producers  
2. Perfect information  
3. Perfect competition  
4. No positive/negative externalities  
5. Perfect factor mobility  
6. Sells only private goods  

Safe to say, reality is not always so kind to our model. As such, when all of the criteria for an 
ideal market are not met, it leads to **Market Failure**.

A **patent** grants an inventor the exclusive rights to produce/sell the product or use the production 
process that is patented for a limited period. A patent aims to promote original research and 
development of new ideas and technological advancements while also helping the firm to 
recover from the costs forked out to engage in R&D.

Patents seek to correct a market failure in the real world: the **“Free Rider, Research and 
Development (R&D)” problem**. R&D tends to come with expensive costs, and thus, revenue & 
profits need to be just as high to fund R&D for any hope of incentivising innovation within a firm. 
The market, in reality, will not let firms reap what they sow, and instead, rival firms may employ a 
technique known as *Stealing Ideas™*. Intellectual property is ridiculously simple to steal: just 
get a glimpse of their idea, and it's yours to make! The lack of **market dominance** from using 
their own idea will drive down prices, ergo, profits.

If companies believe they cannot make back more money than they have spent through R&D, 
they simply will not do so. Further compounding this risk is the fact that not all R&D projects 
even stand to make a profit, let alone revenue, due to:

- Failure to make it past regulatory testing  
- Cultural shifts leading to lack of demand for product  
- Unforeseen issues with product manufacturing  
- Competitors releasing a superior product during a firm’s R&D  

Why would any company ever engage in R&D if they can simply and freely ride off of another 
company’s R&D work, negating all the costs of R&D while reaping similar benefits? **Patents 
seek to eliminate this problem.**

### 2. Why do Patents Exist?

In simple terms, patents are used to **encourage innovation** by providing individuals with rights 
for their inventions over a certain period of time. Over the years, the number of patents filed has 
increased significantly, as shown from the graph below taken by the *World Intellectual Property 
Indicators 2024*.

Patents have a long history, being dated back all the way to **1421**, where the inventor was given 
a three-year monopoly on the manufacture of a barge with hoisting gear used to transport 
marble.

These patents offer protection for all innovators alike to ensure that their ideas will not be made, 
used, sold, offered for sale, or imported. The core objective of **patent laws**, however, is to 
**promote the progress of science and the useful arts**. This principle is enshrined in legal 
traditions, from the **U.S. Constitution (Article I, Section 8)** to foundational court cases like 
*Pennock v. Dialogue (1829)*. 

These patents help to encourage individuals to continue working 
on their ideas, which could potentially lead to greater technological advancements, boosting the 
economy of a country too.

Based on the research done by [bst-europe.eu](http://bst-europe.eu), there is a positive 
relationship between the number of patents and the **Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per 
capita** of a country, further supporting that patents improve a country’s wealth.

However, patents also come with the unintended consequence of **limiting competition** between 
firms since other firms cannot use the knowledge needed to enter the market or produce the 
good in a more cost-effective manner, as the government restricts them from doing so through 
legal barriers.

This results in **dynamic inefficiency** as further innovation within the industry is hindered. Both 
**process innovation** (improving the method of production to reduce unit cost) and **product 
innovation** (improving quality by developing new products) are held back due to patents.

## Glossary of Terms

- **Allocative Efficiency**: Distribution of goods such that societal welfare is maximised, since it’s sold at the point where marginal benefit equals marginal cost.  
- **Free Competition**: A market independent of government intervention, where there is direct interaction between consumers and producers.  
- **Perfectly rational consumers and producers**: Both consume/produce in order to maximize their own net total utility.  
- **Free market system**: Prices and production are determined by supply and demand, with little or no government intervention.  
- **Perfect information**: Everyone in the market knows everything about prices, products, and opportunities.  
- **Perfect competition**: Many buyers and sellers, all selling identical products, and no one can influence the price.  
- **Positive/negative externalities**: Effects of an economic activity on others who are not directly involved.  
  - Positive externality: Benefits others (e.g., education improves society).  
  - Negative externality: Hurts others (e.g., pollution from a factory).  
- **Perfect factor mobility**: Resources like labor and capital can easily move from one use or location to another.  
- **Private goods**: Goods that are owned and consumed by individuals. They are excludable and rivalrous.  
- **Market failure**: When a market does not allocate resources efficiently on its own, leading to loss of welfare.  
- **Patent**: A legal right given to an inventor, allowing them to exclusively produce, sell, or use an invention for a certain period.  
- **Free rider problem**: When someone benefits from a good/service without paying for it.  
- **Research and Development (R&D)**: Activities to create new products or improve existing ones.  
- **Market dominance**: A company has a strong position in a market, able to influence prices or block competition.  
- **Monopoly**: A market structure with only one seller.  
- **Dynamic inefficiency**: Innovation and technological progress are slowed due to reduced competition.  
- **Process innovation**: Improvements in how goods/services are made, usually to cut costs or speed production.  
- **Product innovation**: Creating new or improved goods or services.  
- **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)**: The total value of all goods/services produced within a country in a year.  
- **GDP per capita**: GDP divided by population; shows average output per person.
